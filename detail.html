        <h2><strong><em>Discover Brazil</em></strong></h2>
        <p class="details-text">
            Brazil is the largest country in South America and known for its diverse culture, stunning landscapes,
            and vibrant cities. From the Amazon rainforest to the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro,
            Brazil offers a rich tapestry of experiences for travelers.
        </p>
        <p class="details-text">
            The Brazilian landscape is very varied. It is most well known for its dense forests, including the Amazon, the world's largest jungle, in the north. But there are also dry grasslands (called pampas), rugged hills, pine forests, sprawling wetlands, immense plateaus, and a long coastal plain.
        </p>
        <p class="details-text">
            Whether you're exploring the historical streets of Salvador, relaxing on the beaches of Copacabana,
            or immersing yourself in the Carnival festivities, Brazil captivates with its energy and warmth.
        </p>
        <p class="details-text">
            Northern Brazil is dominated by the Amazon River and the jungles that surround it. The Amazon is not one river but a network of many hundreds of waterways. Its total length stretches 4,250 miles (6,840 kilometers). Thousands of species live in the river, including the infamous piranha and the boto, or pink river dolphin.
